Library to encapsulate a few core concepts of techascent system.


* Smile now supports elasticnet in main distribution.  Use `{:model-type :smile.regression/elasticnet}` in your options.
* [API Documentation](https://techascent.github.io/tech.ml/)



## TODO - Simple Examples Here of Regression/Classification


### Concluding


We have generic support for xgboost and smile.  This gives you quite a few models and
they are all gridsearcheable as above.  We put this forward in an attempt to simplify
doing ML that we do and in an attempt to move the Clojure ML conversation forward
towards getting the best possible results for a dataset in the least amount of
(developer) time.
